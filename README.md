# Summary 
This was my first app where I was using React and Bootstrap. Even though React is pretty similar to vanilla JavaScript, there were some new concepts I had to get familiar with.  At the end it was one particularly challenging and fun experience. Aso, this was my first app deployment done using Heroku and it was seamless process.
